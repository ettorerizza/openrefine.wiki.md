_OpenRefine Roadmap_

This list is from pre-2.2 days and needs to be reprioritized and cleaned up.

Please be aware that none of this is carved in stone and can change any time, so check back regularly.

## 2.2

Feature Areas

- Internationalization
- Streamlining traditional features
- Issue 213: traditional find & replace
- Issue 68: "merge columns" command.

Issues

- Issue 36: Seamless conversion of arrays into multiple columns
- Issue 75: Saveable reconciliation mappings
- Issue 87: Long running processes should serialize intermediate results ? - hard (dfhuynh)

## 2.5

Feature Areas:

- Views: map, timeline, protovis charts

Issues

- Better machinery to guess and re-encode cell values (useful for fixing encoding issues)

## 3.0

Feature Areas:

- Collaborative editing support (really hard)
- RABJ integration (allows to distribute reconciliation loads across multiple people) - not even sure what this means

## Future

Feature Areas:

- Performance - the /project page seems to be slow now
- Column groups
- [https:_github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues#issue/93_](issue+93)

Issues

- Issue 85: Graphical manipulation of widths of fixed-width column data
- Issue 90: Ability to cluster records -- to look for records that look alike and might actually be the same (useful for de-duplication)
- Issue 91: Option or preference to only show Freebase /common types in dropdowns for type and property suggestions.
- Issue 94: Map facet?

## Feature Requests, Bugs, Comments, Etc.
