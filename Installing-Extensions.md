_How to install extensions._

This is applicable to version 2.0 and later only.

Step 1. In OpenRefine's front page ( [http://127.0.0.1:3333/](http://127.0.0.1:3333/) ), click Browse workspace directory at the bottom of the project list. This should open up the workspace directory in your system's file browser.

- If you're running OpenRefine on a Linux server, the workspace directory should be at <tt>~/.local/share/openrefine/</tt>(OpenRefine 2.6 and above) or <tt>~/.local/share/google/refine/</tt>(OpenRefine 2.5 and below).

Step 2. In the workspace directory, create a sub-directory called "extensions" if there isn't one already.

Step 3. Shut down OpenRefine.

Step 4. Download the extension .zip file and unzip it to a sub-directory under the "extensions" directory that you have just created.

Step 5. Start OpenRefine up again.

Note: In Windows the `extensions` directory is part of the directory in which you have installed refine itself.
